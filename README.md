### Gekocaretaker1

Programmer, Game Developer, Person with too many projects.
Gekocaretaker1 is also gekocaretaker!
I have no clue what is supposed to go on this.

Okay.

How about some facts then?

1. Word and other Microsoft documents are just zip files with xml files in them.
2. Blue-Yellow is an impossible light (the energy type, not the color type) color since Blue is a type of light and Yellow is made from Red and Green light, so they cannot mix.
3. Seals are Caniforms; just like dogs, wolves, foxes, and even bears!
4. 1 is a thought, 2 is a discussion, 3 is a belief...
5. There are things smaller than Electrons!
6. It might be actually be possible to create programs that can think, act, and feel just like us (like in Free Guy)! But do we have the right to play God and have the ability to create and kill life as we please?
7. Grape flavor is always artificial, since grapes are mostly water.

Did that satisfy you?

If not, sorry. I might add more in the future!
