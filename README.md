### Gekocaretaker1

Programmer, Game Developer, Person with too many projects.
Gekocaretaker1 is also gekocaretaker!
I have no clue what is supposed to go on this.

Okay.

How about some facts then?

1. Word and other Microsoft documents are just zip files with txt and certain formatting files in them.
2. Blue-Yellow is an impossible color since Blue is a type of light and Yellow is made from Red and Green light, so they cannot mix.
3. Seals are Caniforms; just like dogs, wolves, foxes, and even bears!
4. 1 is a thought, 2 is a discussion, 3 is a belief...
5. There are things smaller than Electrons!

Did that satisfy you?

If not, sorry. I might add more in the future!
